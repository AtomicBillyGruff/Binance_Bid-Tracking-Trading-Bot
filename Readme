-------------------
Crypto bot that sells before the highest asker sells 
or buys before a high volume buyer buys. 

Still in the works and does nees some find tuning. This was an enormous project for me at the time and hopefully it helps if crypto trading is your thing. 
For me personally, I didn't see much money in it after fees but if you catch a good trend, this method is a wonderful way to trade without requireing a trading platform...

------------------Flash Buy & Flash sell-------------

These are what you'd use to quickly sell or buy

-----------------track sell ------------------

something I made to track a previously bought coin to sell it. 
This reads a file that the main file writes to!!!

**********REMEMBER THIS THING IS IN ITS EXTREMELY EARLY STAGES THOUGH IT MIGHT HELP YOU OUT IF CRYPTO TRADING IS YOUR THING ************** I WARNED YOU

Though definately check out the idea with the bidders helps with low volume trades. Good thing to have on a bot so you don't get sweeped away when a 'Whale' sells or buys.
